# Tailwind CSS Webpack Starter Project

This is an example of a super simple [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) setup for using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After that, start up Webpack Development Server:

```
npm run serve
```

Webpack Development Server will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/index.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `/src/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.

To build a production bundle run:

```
npm run build
```

After that, you will have a ready to deploy bundle at `/dist`
